# AI-Based Knowledge Retrieval & Automation System Architecture

## 1. Structured/Unstructured Data Preprocessing Pipeline & RAG Retriever

* **Data Collection**

  * Structured: Databases, APIs, CSV, Excel, etc.
  * Unstructured: Documents, images, audio, logs, web crawlers, etc.
* **Data Preprocessing Pipeline**

  * Data cleansing, deduplication, and format standardization
  * Text extraction (OCR, ASR) and NLP preprocessing (tokenization, lemmatization)
  * Metadata tagging and indexing
* **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Retriever**

  * Vector embeddingâ€“based semantic search
  * Retrieval + generation for LLM-based Q\&A
  * Hybrid search (vector + keyword search) support

---

## 2. Graph DBâ€“Based Relational Knowledge Database

* **Data Modeling**

  * Define entities and relationships
  * Design a knowledge graph structure
  * Map multi-type nodes and property-based relationships
* **Search Capabilities**

  * Multi-hop queries
  * Semantic association search
  * LLM query + graph query (Cypher/Gremlin) integration
* **Use Cases**

  * Domain-specific knowledge networks
  * Insight and relationship analysis
  * Supporting RAG with relational search

---

## 3. LLM-Based Data Modeling & Automation Processes

* **Modeling Pipeline**

  * Data analysis â†’ feature extraction â†’ LLM training/tuning
  * Prompt engineering for improved response quality
* **Automation Processes**

  * Document summarization, tagging, categorization
  * Pattern analysis and anomaly detection
  * Personalized knowledge recommendation
* **Applications**

  * Automated report generation
  * Q\&A chatbots
  * Business process optimization

---

## 4. Agent-Based Third-Party & Internal Service Integration

* **Multi-Agent Setup**

  * Domain-specific agents (e.g., analysis agent, search agent, reporting agent)
  * Orchestration agent for workflow management
* **Service Integration**

  * Third-party APIs: Slack, Jira, Notion, Google Workspace, etc.
  * Internal services: ERP, CRM, in-house data lakes
* **Example Functions**

  * Auto-create/update tickets
  * Real-time data monitoring
  * Workflow-based decision support

---

## 5. MCP-Based Endpoint Provision for Third-Party App Integration

* **MCP (Model Context Protocol) Overview**

  * A standard protocol enabling LLM environments to communicate securely with external apps and services
  * Supports extensible API endpoint architecture
* **Key Components**

  * Authentication/authorization module (OAuth2, API key)
  * Request adapter
  * Data format conversion (JSON â†” XML, etc.)
* **Use Cases**

  * Direct AI assistant integration with CRM, ERP, CMS
  * Workflow automation triggers
  * Real-time data synchronization between apps

---

ðŸ“Œ **Conclusion**
This architecture enables a **full-cycle ecosystem** from **structured/unstructured data collection â†’ preprocessing â†’ RAG search â†’ graph-based relationship exploration â†’ LLM modeling â†’ agent-driven integration â†’ MCP-powered API extensions**, maximizing efficiency and automation in both internal and external data utilization.

If youâ€™d like, I can also create an **architecture diagram** for this in Mermaid or a visual system map so itâ€™s easier to share and understand.
